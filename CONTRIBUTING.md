# Contributing

Thank you for improving DiffMind.

Agent-first operation is a product requirement. New management behavior must be
accessible through the discoverable MCP contract, not just the UI or a CLI flag.
Preserve read-only viewer behavior and cover authorization and failure recovery.
See [agent operations](docs/agent-operations.md) and `TestAgentAcceptance`.

Start with the [reproducible contributor quickstart](docs/contributor-quickstart.md)
to explore a synthetic three-service workspace without company access.
Release maintainers should also read [distribution](docs/distribution.md).

Before opening a pull request:

1. Keep changes focused and include tests for behavior changes.
2. Run `make test`.
3. Run `make test-packs` when changing knowledge packs or extraction rules.
4. Run `make test-race` when changing ingestion, storage, the pack loader, or graph pipeline.
5. Run `make ui-build` when changing either web application.
6. Run `make ui-test` when changing either dashboard or router.
7. Run `make ui-audit` when changing frontend dependencies and `make vulncheck`
   when changing Go dependencies; the accepted reachable vulnerability count
   is zero.
8. Run `diffmind doctor` when changing installation, storage, or onboarding.
9. Do not commit repository contents, generated analysis runs, credentials, or
   organization-specific examples.

Use synthetic names and data in fixtures. New detectors should prefer precise,
source-backed facts over guesses.

When adding support for a framework, ORM or private convention version:

1. Review its upstream migration/API changes and record the bounded supported pattern.
2. Add exact-version positive and negative extraction fixtures, including the
   previous version, unresolved version and a future out-of-range version.
3. Update applicability and `tested_versions` in the detector version registry;
   only fixture-backed exact versions may be called validated.
4. Bump the detector revision when semantics or its fixture matrix changes so
   cached analyses are invalidated, even if extraction code stays the same.
5. Re-run corpus validation and compare changed relationships against reviewed
   expectations. Update the support matrix and release DiffMind.

Private convention configuration uses the same version-evidence policy. Never
infer a framework's version from a similarly numbered parent, build tool or
company library, and keep coverage/provenance out of structural flow diffs.

The workspace dashboard's `npm test` runs both helper tests and JSX component
tests through the real fetch wrapper with an in-memory API stub. The component
runner uses [LinkeDOM](https://github.com/WebReflection/linkedom) for DOM state,
not a full browser; retain browser checks for layout, focus, navigation and TLS.
Its generated test modules are temporary and cleaned up under `node_modules`.

The [current roadmap](docs/ROADMAP.md) is the source of truth for remaining work.
Run `make verify` for comprehensive local checks. The normal Go suite includes
[the synthetic company acceptance fixture](testdata/company/README.md): it builds
the actual CLI and requires Go and Git, but no Docker, framework dependencies,
company access, or LLM. New cross-repository support should add reviewed expected
relationships and source-evidence assertions, including negative cases; do not
accept an empty graph as a passing integration test.

Organization-specific conventions normally belong in a knowledge pack, not in
the core analyzer. Every contributed pack must declare an open-source license,
use synthetic fixtures, and pass both `diffmind pack lint` and
`diffmind pack test`. See [the pack authoring guide](docs/knowledge-packs.md).

`diffmind pack init ./my-pack --id example.conventions` now scaffolds a complete
identity → declaration → graph test. Use exact dependencies/exposures with
file/line assertions, an expected full graph, and at least one negative fixture.
The official packs are tested by both `go test ./...` and `make test-packs`.
Document supported patterns and exclusions in the pack README and update the
[support matrix](docs/supported-patterns.md). Framework-specific claims should
link to upstream documentation; proprietary conventions need synthetic examples.
