# Current architecture

Diffmind is a deterministic architecture knowledge platform. The default product
workflow is agent-operated installation, onboarding and management. The project
workspace UI and manual CLI remain optional views/controls over the same core.

`internal/extractor` parses source/configuration, runs static detectors and
connection analysis, and emits Protocol documents with source evidence.
`protocol` defines that interchange contract. `internal/workspace` owns project
storage, repository synchronization, packs, graph assembly, queries, and MCP.
`cmd/diffmind` ships both through one executable.

`diffmind agent` is the local full-management stdio entry point. Its
`internal/workspace/agenthost` controller starts a backend on an inherited,
reserved loopback socket and supervises its lifetime through an owner pipe.
The controller serializes backend management with offline CLI maintenance,
while the backend retains the existing server/maintenance leases. Settings
persist in `agent-settings.json`; the controller owns a separate lifecycle lock
under `agent-controller/`. Normal disconnect or owner crash stops the backend.

`internal/workspace/agentapi` supplies the finite operation catalog and MCP
management tools. Remote calls re-enter the same HTTP authorization, validation,
quota and audit middleware using the current request credentials. Viewer MCP
and the original `diffmind mcp` remain query-only. Local runtime/maintenance tools
are not exposed remotely. See [agent operations](agent-operations.md) and
[bootstrap](../AGENT_SETUP.md).

Knowledge packs are declarative data, not arbitrary executable plugins. They
teach service identity, configuration/resource naming, relationship resolution,
and evidence-backed HTTP/RPC/queue declarations through field paths or regexes.
Pack collection and deterministic resolver results feed the graph snapshot read
by both UI and MCP. Framework-specific AST detectors still live in the engine;
packs cannot execute code or introduce new AST analysis algorithms. See the
[tested support matrix](supported-patterns.md).

Local and shared deployments use the same filesystem-backed metadata/artifact
store, with an opt-in indexed SQLite refresh queue. Analysis runs
as cancellable child processes; graph building runs in-process. The shared
profile adds a persisted refresh queue, scheduled/webhook triggers, bounded
project and repository-operation workers, remote MCP, and authentication through
an admin token, scoped project agent token, or trusted identity proxy. It is not a distributed queue or
multi-tenant database service. A data directory must have one server writer.

No model provider is required for extraction. See [the roadmap](ROADMAP.md)
for remaining work.

## Local data

`DIFFMIND_HOME` (default `~/.diffmind`) contains central `config.json`, the
`diffmind-packs.lock`, installed `packs/`, repository analysis `runs/`, and
`projects/<id>/`. Each project contains `project.json`, latest `ingestion.json`,
`ingestions/<id>/attempt-*.json`, optional `access.json` memberships and
`tokens.json` credential verifiers/history, `limits.json` resource caps, `repos/`, project `packs/`, and versioned graph
`runs/`. Root-level `jobs/` stores JSON refresh jobs and their attempt history;
after explicit offline migration, `queue/queue.sqlite` becomes the authoritative
job store and the original JSON is retained only as historical input. Store
checkpoints use same-directory temporary writes, file sync, and atomic rename.
Offline snapshots preserve these records without rewriting history. Maintenance
leases coordinate the CLI with backup; restore validates in private staging and
never replaces an existing destination. These are not distributed writer locks
or schema migrations. See [recovery](backup-recovery.md).

Managed backup catalogs live outside the workspace and bind receipts to a
canonical home plus random catalog identity. Rotation verifies the old catalog
and a new archive, publishes a complete snapshot atomically, then removes only
expired catalog-owned archives. No live record history is pruned. Linux systemd
maintenance scheduling is operator-installed and preserves the target service's
prior running state. See [backup automation](backup-automation.md).

The SQLite queue uses transactional admission/claims, a per-project active-job
constraint, indexed page queries and attempt aggregates. A private staging
database is verified before atomic no-replace activation. Shared lifecycle code
keeps JSON and SQLite behavior aligned. CLI servers acquire a local singleton
lock before recovery; analyzers/MCP retain shared maintenance access. Queue
transactions do not include external processes or graph files. See
[queue migration and limits](queue-storage.md); distributed workers remain future work.

Project limits bound queued/running refresh admission and simultaneous repository
sync/analyzer work. Queue policy checks share the store's admission lock/transaction.
The server admits repository operations against global and project counters
together, and a change notification wakes waiting work after releases or policy
updates. Reductions drain without rewriting accepted jobs. Policies use atomic
revision-checked files, remain admin-only in either access mode, and are not OS
resource isolation. See [resource limits](operations.md#per-project-resource-limits).

## Deployment boundaries

The local default binds to loopback without authentication. A non-loopback bind
requires `DIFFMIND_AUTH_TOKEN` or `DIFFMIND_TRUSTED_PROXY_SECRET`; overriding that
guard requires the explicit `--allow-unauthenticated` flag. Middleware protects
the SPA, APIs, event streams, and MCP; `/healthz` remains public. Trusted-proxy
identities carry viewer/editor/admin roles; mutations are audited.
The exact project GitHub webhook POST route has separate raw-body HMAC
authentication and never grants access to other APIs. `/metrics` remains behind
normal authentication. See [operations](operations.md).

The rootless application container has no Linux capabilities and keeps durable
writes in `/data`. TLS and OIDC login belong at the reverse proxy; Diffmind
validates the proxy secret and enforces the resulting user's role.

`DIFFMIND_PROJECT_ACCESS=scoped` adds explicit per-project viewer/editor grants.
Independent [agent tokens](agent-tokens.md) can grant the same one-project roles
without proxy identity. Only global admins issue/revoke them; expiry and
revocation are rechecked from their hash-only registry. They are disabled in
legacy mode and never fall back to a stronger identity on authentication failure.
The default `legacy` mode keeps global roles. Route-level checks resolve project
ownership before handlers read data; query-service policies filter discovery
and enforce explicit/default project selection. Scoped remote MCP creates fresh
stateless per-request servers to avoid cached identity privileges. Access policies
use atomic writes with optimistic revisions. Configuration/imports remain
admin-only in scoped mode because all projects share the host and analyzer
credentials. Global admins, shared server tokens, OS users and local stdio MCP
retain trusted access. See [project access](project-access.md) for the exact
boundary and revocation limitations.

## Knowledge precedence

Identity is assembled from a repository-owned `.diffmind/service.yaml` override,
then matching project/globally installed packs by explicit priority, then the
repository name as fallback. Equal-priority conflicting service identities fail
instead of silently choosing one. Graph runs record `knowledge_pack_set_digest`
for the exact pack content used.

## Snapshot queries

The comparison screen, versioned HTTP endpoints, and MCP tools share
`internal/workspace/query`. Comparison projects persisted architecture graphs
into semantic facts in `internal/workspace/archgraph`; it does not reanalyze
source or modify run artifacts. Both run IDs are mandatory. Directed path
queries retain saved edge evidence and report incomplete searches explicitly.
Object traces only attach exact-ID local connections and dependency details;
they do not infer execution continuity from neighboring services. See
[graph history and tracing](graph-history.md) for the contract and limits.

Protocol evidence references are hydrated into snapshot graph facts with file,
line, snippet hash and repository revision metadata. MCP service responses are
compact by default and dependency edges are paginated; callers opt into full
fact/evidence detail when needed.
