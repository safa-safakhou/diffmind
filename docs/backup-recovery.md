# Offline backup and recovery

Diffmind can create, verify, and restore versioned snapshots on macOS and Linux.
This is disaster recovery for workspace files (including a migrated SQLite queue), not live snapshots, schema
migration. For verified keep-last rotation and operator-installed scheduled
maintenance, see [managed backup automation](backup-automation.md).

## Create and verify

Stop the server, stdio MCP processes, graph/analysis commands, and all other
writers first. Older binaries do not honor maintenance locks.

```bash
export DIFFMIND_HOME=/srv/diffmind
diffmind backup create --offline --output /backups/diffmind-snapshot.tar.gz --json
diffmind backup verify --archive /backups/diffmind-snapshot.tar.gz --json
```

The report includes the producing version, original home, creation time, counts,
and SHA-256 of the **entire compressed archive**. Save the digest separately in
your backup system; provide it as `--sha256 DIGEST` when verifying/restoring.
Per-file checksums detect damage, but the archive's own manifest is not a
signature. Protect the archive and trusted checksum from tampering.

The source must contain `projects/`. The output parent must exist. Existing
archives are never overwritten, and output must be outside `DIFFMIND_HOME`.
Creation reads each file twice and checks both hashes; it fails if copied
content changes. Publication happens only after the complete archive is synced.

## Scope and confidentiality

**Every file under the home** is included except the maintenance lock: project
configuration, installed packs, analysis artifacts, graphs, job/delivery receipts,
ingestion history, audit logs, and managed worktrees (including `.git`) when
inside the home. Original JSON timestamps and record bytes are not rewritten.

Project `limits.json` policies, revisions and update times are included. A
restore reinstates the snapshot's caps, not later administrative changes; review
them before admitting work. Effective caps still obey the restarted server's
global configuration. Active in-memory operation counts restart at zero.

Project `tokens.json` registries contain hashed credential verifiers, grants and
creation/expiry/revocation history and are also included. **An older restore can
reactivate tokens revoked after its snapshot.** Keep external access disabled
during recovery and review/revoke or rotate restored tokens before reopening.
Absolute expiry times are preserved, not renewed. See [agent tokens](agent-tokens.md).

Archives are mode `0600` but **not encrypted**. They can contain company source
and accidentally stored secrets. Never attach them to public issues/releases.
Use your backup system for encryption, access control, off-host copies, and
retention. Environment credentials, external source directories, proxy config,
and external volumes are not copied; back up these dependencies separately.

Regular-file/directory modification times and ordinary permission bits are
preserved. Ownership, ACLs, xattrs, hard-link identity, sparse layout, and symlink
modification times are not. Restored content belongs to the restoring user.
The new workspace root is private (`0700`); its original mode/time are not copied.
Relative symlinks must point to a saved regular file/directory. Absolute,
external, dangling, and chained links are rejected. Sockets, FIFOs, devices and
unsupported archive types are rejected, not silently omitted. Use a filesystem
backup for excluded source layouts; do not delete source just to make this pass.

## Reconcile access before reopening

Treat restoring authority as a separate step from verifying archive integrity.
Keep the identity proxy, ordinary MCP clients and webhook ingress disconnected
while the operator inspects the restored home. Retain the current offboarding
register outside backups. Read each restored membership policy, remove exact
departed subjects using its current revision, and revoke explicitly assigned
project token IDs independently. A membership edit does not revoke a token.

Probe the isolated restored instance with departed proxy identities and revoked
tokens: expect inaccessible-project responses and authentication denial,
respectively. Verify unrelated service credentials and admin recovery still
work. Inspect interrupted jobs in Operations and cancel unwanted admitted work
before reconnecting ingress. Record verification times, archive digest, restored
version/path and reviewed grants privately. Failed reconciliation keeps ordinary
traffic disconnected; switching to legacy is not a recovery workaround.

The disposable regression drill uses the actual archive create/verify/restore,
store and authenticated HTTP handlers with JSON and SQLite queues:

```bash
go test ./internal/workspace/ui -run TestOfflineRestoreRequiresAccessReconciliation -v -count=1
go test ./internal/workspace/backup ./internal/workspace/store
```

It proves that a snapshot taken before offboarding restores both the departed
membership and token, then verifies explicit removal while preserving unrelated
service and recovery grants. It also recovers an interrupted queue job. No
ordinary listener opens during this test. Its small synthetic fixture timings
are observations, not a production recovery-time promise.

## Recovery drill

Verification extracts nothing. Also practice restoration to an isolated new path:

```bash
diffmind backup restore --offline \
  --archive /backups/diffmind-snapshot.tar.gz \
  --destination /recovery/diffmind-drill \
  --sha256 TRUSTED_ARCHIVE_DIGEST --allow-path-mismatch
```

The parent must exist; the destination must **not exist**, even as an empty
directory or symlink. Restore validates in a private sibling staging directory,
then uses an atomic **no-replace** rename. A competing process creating the
destination makes restore fail safely. Failed restores clean up staging files;
a killed process may leave an unpublished `.diffmind-restore-*` directory for an
operator to inspect and remove.

By default the canonical destination must match the recorded home.
`--allow-path-mismatch` permits inspection/drills, **not relocation**: absolute
repository, pack, analysis and evidence paths remain unchanged. Do not start
workers in a relocated copy until dependencies have been deliberately reviewed.

For real recovery, stop the service, verify the backup, and preserve existing
data as a rollback copy. Move it aside only after checking paths and free space.
Restore into the original now-absent path with the recorded application version.
Re-supply credentials/proxy configuration, run `diffmind doctor`, inspect saved
graphs, then start one server. Queued/interrupted jobs follow normal restart
rules; completed jobs are not reset. Check Operations before reconnecting hooks.

For [SQLite queue storage](queue-storage.md), restore the entire workspace,
including `queue/` and any database journal, then run
`diffmind storage verify --offline`. Historical `jobs/*.json` files are not an
alternative live queue after migration. Never remove `queue/` to downgrade.

For Compose, stop the service and run a one-shot container with the same
image/user, the data volume, and a separate writable backup mount for
`backup create`/`verify`. The maintenance lock is inside `/data`, shared by
containers. Restore cannot replace a mountpoint: use a new directory on a
recovery volume with `--allow-path-mismatch`, inspect it, then have the operator
promote its contents to a fresh volume mounted at the original `/data` path.
Keep the old volume for rollback. Volume promotion is not automated by this CLI;
all writers must stay stopped throughout it.

## Compatibility and limits

- Format **1** is accepted; unknown formats fail. Producing application version
  is recorded but application schemas are not transformed.
- Default expanded-file limit: **100 GiB**, configurable with `--max-bytes N`
  for create, verify and restore. Maximum 200,000 entries and 32 MiB manifest.
  File contents stream; restore needs space for the uncompressed workspace.
- Requires local filesystem locks, hard links, and atomic no-replace rename.
  Network/shared filesystems are not supported for coordination. This is not a
  full power-loss-safe multi-file transaction.
- Current CLI processes hold shared maintenance leases; backup holds an
  exclusive lease. This prevents maintenance overlap; current CLI servers also
  hold a separate local `.diffmind-server.lock` to reject second server writers.
  Never unlink either lock to bypass it. The file
  normally remains after shutdown; the kernel releases leases on process exit.
- Library/embedded users must arrange their own quiescence. `--offline` is
  required because old binaries and direct filesystem writes are not detectable.

Tests restore historical graphs and original attempts from the real three-service
CLI fixture, and cover corruption, path/link attacks, future formats, limits,
timestamps, permissions, cross-process contention, and non-overwrite publication.
