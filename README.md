# DiffMind

DiffMind turns your source repositories into an explorable architecture graph
for you and your coding agent. Inspect services, endpoints, dependencies, queues
and data stores; follow source evidence; compare saved graphs; and ask questions
through MCP. Your agent can also install, configure and operate the workspace.
Analysis is deterministic: no LLM or model API key is needed to build the graph.

DiffMind is built for the questions that become expensive once work crosses
repository boundaries:

- What calls this endpoint, publishes this event, or writes this table?
- Which services and contracts may be affected by the change I am planning?
- What source evidence supports each relationship, and how fresh is it?
- Can my coding agent query the same architecture instead of guessing from one
  checkout at a time?

It combines a local dashboard, persisted graph history, contract comparison and
an MCP interface. The result is an evidence-backed map that humans can inspect
and agents can use while planning and implementing changes.

One repository, one `diffmind` command. Run it privately on your laptop or as a
continuously refreshed, single-server workspace for a team.

**Release status:** `v0.1.0` is the first public release. Checksummed native
binaries are available for macOS and Linux on Intel/AMD64 and ARM64. The source
workflow remains available, and pinned Homebrew installation is documented in
[distribution](docs/distribution.md).

## See it work—from 6 to 150 services

![DiffMind public proof: Demo Shop, Google Online Boutique, OpenTelemetry Demo, and a 150-service generated company](docs/assets/readme/public-proof.png)

The public proof is deliberately split into four jobs. No single fixture is
allowed to blur product behavior, framework coverage and scalability:

- **Demo Shop** is the polished, end-to-end extraction and change story.
- **Google Online Boutique** is the pinned gRPC compatibility benchmark.
- **OpenTelemetry Demo** is the pinned polyglot compatibility benchmark.
- **Northstar Enterprise** is a deterministic 10-team, 150-service navigation
  fixture with generated metrics and topology—never presented as runtime data.

The [DiffMind Demo Shop](examples/demo-shop/README.md) is a public-safe,
six-repository system designed to make the core workflow obvious: import a
storefront, gateway, catalog, checkout, payment and notification service;
inspect HTTP, queue, cache and database relationships; then change the checkout
request contract and compare the two graph runs. It uses synthetic names and
hostnames, so it is safe for screenshots, talks and social posts.

```bash
make build
sh scripts/prepare-showcase.sh /tmp/diffmind-demo-shop
```

The expected topology and contract fields are checked into the repository, and
`make test-showcase` verifies the generator and every individual service scan.
For a less curated view, the [public compatibility benchmarks](examples/public-benchmarks/README.md)
pin OpenTelemetry Demo and Google Online Boutique revisions and record what
DiffMind currently detects—and, just as importantly, what still needs framework
support. The benchmarks are visible here precisely because zero resolved
connections is useful evidence: it identifies protobuf/gRPC and
configuration-resolution work without exaggerating current coverage.

To exercise a company with ten teams and fifteen services per team, generate
the [synthetic enterprise workspace](examples/enterprise-showcase/README.md):

```bash
make enterprise-showcase DEST=/tmp/diffmind-enterprise
DIFFMIND_HOME=/tmp/diffmind-enterprise ./bin/diffmind ui --no-spa-rebuild
```

Large workspaces open in a readable team scope. The graph states how many
services and relationships are visible, can include immediate cross-team
neighbors, supports direct service search, and still offers the complete
portfolio map.

The complete, reproducible walkthrough—including the topology, contract-change
result, capture provenance, and the role of the two real-world benchmarks—is in
[Public demo and media](docs/public-demo.md).

## Start with your agent

You do not need to run a terminal command, start a server, create a project or
add repositories in the UI. Give your host coding agent this request:

> Set up DiffMind for me using AGENT_SETUP.md in this repository. Install and
> register its full-management MCP connection, create or reuse my work project,
> preview and import these repositories: REPOSITORIES_OR_ORG. Build the graph,
> wait for completion, and verify known dependencies with source evidence.
> Perform the setup yourself; do not give me commands or UI chores.

[AGENT_SETUP.md](AGENT_SETUP.md) is the executable playbook for the host agent.
It runs the source installer, receives machine-readable MCP configuration, and
registers it with the user's client. The client launches `diffmind agent`, which
starts its own backend on an available loopback port. No project needs to exist.
The dashboard remains optional; the agent can return its URL when requested.

The full-management connection exposes:

- **describe_management**, **inspect_workspace**, **manage_workspace**: discover
  operations, create/configure projects, import repositories, build/refresh graphs,
  monitor/cancel/retry jobs, edit packs/configuration, and administer access,
  tokens and quotas. It reuses the API's validation, permissions and audit log.
- **agent_runtime**: inspect/start/stop/restart the owned backend and persist its
  refresh schedule and worker settings.
- **agent_command**: scaffold/lint/test/explain/install packs, run doctor, and
  perform backups or queue maintenance. It drains/restarts the backend around
  commands; it is a bounded DiffMind command interface, not an arbitrary shell.
- The existing **13 graph tools** for services, evidence, dependencies, impact,
  nested contract search/comparison, history and tracing.

You authorize repository access and any client/system installation permissions;
the agent does the operational work. An MCP server cannot grant itself initial
permission inside its host client or obtain company credentials on your behalf.
The bootstrap requires a host agent with authorized shell/configuration access.

Local agent mode has full workspace authority. It stops its backend when the
owning agent disconnects or crashes; work/history persist and reconnect starts
it again. One lifecycle owner is allowed per home. Additional agents can connect
to that backend's HTTP `/mcp`, or use an always-on
[shared deployment](docs/company-deployment.md). Remote agents have the rights
of their authenticated identity; viewer tokens remain read-only.

See [agent operations](docs/agent-operations.md) for tool inputs, lifecycle,
recovery, teaching patterns and the tested end-to-end workflow.

## Manual installation (alternative)

The following is optional for people who prefer operating DiffMind themselves.
It is not required by the agent-first workflow above.

Source builds require **Go 1.26.6 or newer**, **Git**, and a **C compiler** for
tree-sitter/CGO. Supported targets are macOS and Linux, on Intel/AMD64 and ARM64;
Windows binaries are not provided. On macOS, the Xcode Command Line Tools supply
Git and the compiler (`xcode-select --install` if missing). On Linux, install
your distribution's Git and C build tools. Use the Go version in [go.mod](go.mod),
rather than assuming the OS package is recent enough.

Node.js and Docker are **not needed for normal local use**. Both web interfaces
are embedded. Node.js 24 is needed only to rebuild them; Docker is optional for
containerized indexing or shared deployment.

Install the latest checksummed release without a Go or Node.js toolchain:

```bash
diffmind_install_tmp=$(mktemp -d)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mohammad-safakhou/diffmind/master/install.sh \
  -o "$diffmind_install_tmp/install.sh"
# Review the downloaded script before running it.
DIFFMIND_INSTALL_DIR="$HOME/.local/bin" sh "$diffmind_install_tmp/install.sh"
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
diffmind version --json
diffmind doctor
```

The installer verifies the archive checksum before installation. Set
`DIFFMIND_VERSION=0.1.0` on the installer command to pin this release.

To build from source instead:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mohammad-safakhou/diffmind.git
cd diffmind
git switch master
# Already have this checkout? Install its committed implementation from here.
mkdir -p "$HOME/.local/bin"
GOBIN="$HOME/.local/bin" go install ./cmd/diffmind
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
diffmind version --json
```

Keep that PATH setting in your shell configuration for new terminals. A source
build may report `dev`/`unknown` version fields; that is not an installation
failure. To run without installing, use `make build` and `./bin/diffmind` instead.

Create a separate workspace for your work trial, outside any source repository:

```bash
export DIFFMIND_HOME="$HOME/.diffmind-work"
mkdir -p "$DIFFMIND_HOME"
chmod 700 "$DIFFMIND_HOME"
diffmind doctor
diffmind ui --no-spa-rebuild
```

Open **http://127.0.0.1:8090**. The server stays in the foreground; Ctrl+C stops
it. Warnings about no projects/graphs on first use are expected. The
`--no-spa-rebuild` flag uses the embedded UI without looking for Node in a source
checkout. Keep the same `DIFFMIND_HOME` whenever you restart or connect an agent.

1. Create a project, then choose **Import & build**.
2. Choose **Local directory** and a folder containing your Git repositories, or
   **GitHub org** and your organization name. Start with a few related services.
   Use **Include regex** and **Dry run only** to preview the selection.
3. Disable **Dry run only** and start **Import and build graph**. Wait for
   completion, review repository errors, then inspect services, edges and their
   source evidence. A partial result can contain older analysis: check freshness.
4. Use **Update graph** after changes. Unchanged, verified analysis is reused;
   **Operations** shows history, cancellation and retries. **Compare graphs**
   compares saved versions.

Local imports use existing paths, not copies; they are not automatically pulled
from Git remotes. GitHub imports create managed clones and sync their configured
branches. For private GitHub access, supply a read-only `GITHUB_TOKEN` to the
server using approved secret handling. Do not paste it into source files or
agent settings. See [personal setup](docs/personal-setup.md) for exact credential,
daily refresh, backup and troubleshooting steps.

Want to test without company data? Use the six-service Demo Shop above for the
complete public workflow, or follow the smaller
[three-service contributor quickstart](docs/contributor-quickstart.md).

## Manual read-only agent connection

For full management use the agent-first setup above (`diffmind agent`). The
following keeps the original read-only `diffmind mcp` integration available.

Build the graph first, then find its project ID:

```bash
export DIFFMIND_HOME="$HOME/.diffmind-work"
diffmind list projects
```

For Codex, replace `PROJECT_ID` with that ID:

```bash
codex mcp add diffmind-work --env DIFFMIND_HOME="$DIFFMIND_HOME" -- \
  "$HOME/.local/bin/diffmind" mcp --project PROJECT_ID
```

The client starts MCP itself; do not run `diffmind mcp` in another terminal.
The UI can be stopped when querying saved graphs, but must run for UI actions
or scheduled refresh. Absolute paths and an explicit home avoid accidentally
opening a different workspace from a GUI-launched agent.

Ask your agent:

> Use DiffMind to list this project's services. Explain what depends on
> SERVICE_NAME, cite source evidence, and report graph freshness and unresolved
> dependencies. Do not infer missing relationships as facts.

The same stdio server works with Claude Code, Cursor and other MCP clients.
[Agent setup examples](docs/personal-setup.md#connect-an-agent) include their
configuration and connection checks. MCP offers service discovery, search,
dependency traversal, change impact, graph and request-contract comparison, and
exact-ID local tracing.
It reads persisted artifacts; it does not refresh repositories or modify code.
`get_service` returns a compact summary by default; request `detail: "full"`
when you need object-level facts and hydrated source locations. `get_dependencies`
supports `offset` and `limit` so large services can be inspected incrementally.

Local stdio is trusted workspace access. `--project` chooses a default,
**not an authorization boundary**. For restricted shared access, use HTTP MCP
with a [project-scoped viewer token](docs/agent-tokens.md).

## Privacy and current limits

- Analysis and graph storage run on your machine, without an LLM. Git imports
  contact your Git provider; optional developer/indexer tooling may use the
  network. This is not a sandbox for untrusted repositories.
- Graphs can contain internal names, URLs, paths and source evidence. MCP results
  enter your agent's context and may reach its model provider. Use only
  company-approved agents and data policies.
- `DIFFMIND_HOME` defaults to `~/.diffmind`. Keep company workspaces and backups
  private, outside Git and public file-sharing folders. Backups are not encrypted.
- Static analysis is not a runtime inventory or a guarantee of full coverage.
  Literal same-file Python URL constants are resolved and recognized dynamic
  `requests` calls are retained as unresolved; wrappers and broader runtime
  configuration can still leave gaps. Check the
  [tested support matrix](docs/supported-patterns.md) and validate known
  relationships before relying on the graph at work.
- One server writes each workspace. Distributed workers, automatic SSO group
  provisioning and automatic workspace-path relocation are not implemented.
  See the [roadmap](docs/ROADMAP.md) and
  [verification record](docs/readiness-verification.md) for scope and evidence.

## Teach your conventions

Knowledge packs add service identities, configuration mappings, HTTP/RPC
relationships and queue conventions without an LLM or executable plugin.

```bash
diffmind pack init ./my-pack --id example.conventions
# Adapt the rules and synthetic positive/negative fixtures first.
diffmind pack lint ./my-pack
diffmind pack test ./my-pack
diffmind pack explain ./my-pack --repo /absolute/path/to/a/service
diffmind pack install ./my-pack
```

Use **Update graph** in the same workspace after installation. Packs are
versioned and integrity-checked. Keep proprietary packs private; contribute only
sanitized rules and synthetic fixtures. Language semantics belong in AST
detectors, not broad source regexes. See [pack authoring](docs/knowledge-packs.md),
[service manifests](packs/service-manifest/README.md), and
[OpenFeign configuration](packs/spring-openfeign-config/README.md).

Agents can record concrete extraction gaps through the revisioned
`list_improvement_gaps`, `record_improvement_gap`, and
`transition_improvement_gap` management operations. Follow the
[agent improvement playbook](docs/agent-improvement-loop.md): proposals remain
separate from graph facts until deterministic tests and human acceptance.

## Team deployment

Follow [company deployment](docs/company-deployment.md). From a source checkout
with Docker Engine and Compose, create `.env` only if it does not already exist:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
chmod 600 .env
# Edit .env: set DIFFMIND_AUTH_TOKEN to a secret from `openssl rand -hex 32`.
docker compose up -d --build
docker compose ps
```

Compose publishes port 8090 on the host; restrict network access before starting
it. Browser authentication accepts any
username and uses the shared token as the password. That token grants global
admin access: keep it out of developers' agent settings. Before team access,
configure TLS and authenticated ingress, restrict direct backend access, and use
[project permissions](docs/project-access.md) and
[expiring viewer tokens](docs/agent-tokens.md) for agents at `/mcp`.

Compose persists data in `diffmind-data` and enables refresh on startup and every
15 minutes. The local binary does **not** schedule refresh by default. Host
source paths are not automatically available in containers; use managed clones
or deliberate mounts. `docker compose down -v` deletes the workspace volume.

[Operations](docs/operations.md) covers signed GitHub webhooks, bounded queues,
workers, project quotas and metrics. [SQLite queue storage](docs/queue-storage.md)
is optional for larger histories. [Backup/recovery](docs/backup-recovery.md) and
[backup automation](docs/backup-automation.md) cover offline snapshots, rotation,
restoration and the opt-in systemd timer, not live/distributed backups.

The running UI serves read-only graph queries, including:

```text
GET /api/v1/projects
GET /api/v1/projects/{id}/graph/summary
GET /api/v1/projects/{id}/services
GET /api/v1/projects/{id}/dependencies?service=NAME&direction=both
GET /api/v1/projects/{id}/impact?target=NAME&depth=6
GET /api/v1/projects/{id}/search?q=QUERY&limit=50
```

Single-graph queries accept
`run=<completed-run-id>`; comparisons require explicit `from` and `to` IDs.
[Graph history and tracing](docs/graph-history.md) documents routes and parameters.
Shared-server requests require authentication; only `/healthz` is public.

## Contribute

Start with [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) and the
[synthetic contributor quickstart](docs/contributor-quickstart.md). Pull requests
target `master`. Keep company code, internal URLs, tokens and workspace artifacts
out of issues and contributions. Report vulnerabilities privately using
[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

```bash
make test                 # Go tests, including real CLI company acceptance
make test-packs           # Official pack fixtures and graph assertions
make test-race            # Go race detector
make ui-build             # npm ci + build both interfaces (Node 24)
make ui-test              # Frontend helpers and component tests
make build
# Complete local verification (also needs Ruby and network access):
make verify
```

External SCIP integrations need additional language toolchains/indexers:
`make test-integration` opts into them. Native release and container validation
are separate; local tests do not certify every platform or company's patterns.
